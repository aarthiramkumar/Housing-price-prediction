# Housing Price Prediction

## Overview

The Housing Price Prediction project is a machine learning model developed using Jupyter Notebook via Anaconda Navigator. The goal of this project is to predict housing prices based on various features such as water facilities, surrounding amenities (schools, universities, markets), house structure, number of rooms, electricity details, current facilities, and the location area. The model not only provides present pricing predictions but also attempts to forecast future development and pricing trends when the house is on sale.

## Technologies Used

- **Jupyter Notebook:** Used as the primary development environment for building and testing the machine learning model.

- **Anaconda Navigator:** Facilitates the management of packages, environments, and notebooks.

- **Python Libraries:**
  - Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - NumPy: For numerical operations.
  - Scikit-learn: Used for building and training the machine learning model.
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle. It includes comprehensive information about various houses, encompassing features that contribute to the prediction model.

## Project Structure

- **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:** Jupyter notebooks detailing the exploration and preprocessing steps performed on the dataset.

- **Model Development:** Jupyter notebook containing the machine learning model development, training, and evaluation.

- **Prediction and Future Trends:** Another notebook focusing on predicting housing prices and forecasting future development and pricing trends.


## Future Development
- Explore additional features for improving prediction accuracy.
- Implement advanced machine learning algorithms.
- Enhance visualization for a better understanding of predictions.
